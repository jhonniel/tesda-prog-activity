    <p>Standing outside the door, the new bride lost in her thought train. She remembered how she daily used to buzz the door bell numerous times, just to tease her parents in a sweet manner. That numerous bell became a sign of her entry for the parents.</p>

    <p>Now, as she was at her in-laws, she just pressed the doorbell once. Miles away, on the other hand, her parents were missing the sounds of numerous bells. That's how the rhythm of bells and her life got changed.</p>
